abstract: Bariatric surgery has been the first-line treatment for obesity. Since
  the 2010s, gradual changes in miRNAs upon surgery have been observed.
  Substantial research has been undertaken on the role of bariatric surgery in
  the gastrointestinal tract. However, bariatric surgery research largely
  ignores the role of miRNAs in organs other than the gastrointestinal tract,
  while the contribution of miRNAs to this process has received little
  attention. This review addresses a neglected aspect of miRNAs in obese
  patients undergoing bariatric surgery, especially the obvious effect on
  multisystem organs. This finding provides evidence that miRNAs play a complex
  yet important role in the functional stability of each organ and the weight
  loss efficacy after bariatric surgery. The results provide a solid evidence
  base for the mechanism of bariatric surgery. Taking into account incompatible
  medication adherence associated with adverse outcomes, suggestions were
  identified for an efficient technical refinement of bariatric surgery with
  better clinical results.
