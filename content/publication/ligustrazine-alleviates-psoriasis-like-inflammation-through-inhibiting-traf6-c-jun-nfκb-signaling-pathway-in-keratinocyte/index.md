abstract: Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort (Ligusticum; Apiaceae) (accepted name,
  Ligusticum striatum DC, on "The Plant List" for the latest version) is a
  Chinese herbal medicine (CHM) which mainly distributed in Sichuan Basin,
  China. Chuanxiong is the dried rhizome of Ligusticum chuanxiong Hort.
  Ligustrazine, also known as tetramethylpyrazine (TMP), is a main active
  fraction of chuanxiong. The aim of this study was to clarify the underlying
  mechanisms by which TMP protect against psoriasis-like inflammation in
  keratinocytes. Here, we demonstrated that TMP alleviated the severity and PASI
  scores of IMQ-induced psoriasis-like skin lesion in vivo. For the
  histopathology level, TMP inhibited the over-proliferation of keratinocytes in
  the epidermis and the substantial immune cells influx in dermis. For the
  mechanism of the ability of TMP on regulating inflammation, we confirmed that
  TMP regulate the TRAF6/c-JUN/NFκB signaling pathway through analyzing the
  proteomics profiling and verifying the expression of TRAF6, pho-c-Jun,
  pho-NFκB, so that the downstream psoriasis-relevant genes transcribed by c-JUN
  or NFκB were down-regulated. Furthermore, we predicted TRAF6 as the potential
  binding point of TMP. Accordingly, our study demonstrated that TMP regulated
  psoriasis-like inflammation through inhibiting TRAF6/c-JUN/NFκB signaling
  pathway in keratinocytes, which potentially provides evidence of the mechanism
  of TMP in the treatment and prevention of psoriasis.
