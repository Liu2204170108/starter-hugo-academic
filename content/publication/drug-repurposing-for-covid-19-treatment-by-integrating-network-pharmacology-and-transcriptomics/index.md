abstract: Since coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a serious new worldwide
  public health crisis with significant morbidity and mortality, effective
  therapeutic treatments are urgently needed. Drug repurposing is an efficient
  and cost-effective strategy with minimum risk for identifying novel potential
  treatment options by repositioning therapies that were previously approved for
  other clinical outcomes. Here, we used an integrated network-based
  pharmacologic and transcriptomic approach to screen drug candidates novel for
  COVID-19 treatment. Network-based proximity scores were calculated to identify
  the drug-disease pharmacological effect between drug-target relationship
  modules and COVID-19 related genes. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was
  then performed to determine whether drug candidates influence the expression
  of COVID-19 related genes and examine the sensitivity of the repurposing drug
  treatment to peripheral immune cell types. Moreover, we used the complementary
  exposure model to recommend potential synergistic drug combinations. We
  identified 18 individual drug candidates including nicardipine, orantinib,
  tipifarnib and promethazine which have not previously been proposed as
  possible treatments for COVID-19. Additionally, 30 synergistic drug pairs were
  ultimately recommended including fostamatinib plus tretinoin and orantinib
  plus valproic acid. Differential expression genes of most repurposing drugs
  were enriched significantly in B cells. The findings may potentially
  accelerate the discovery and establishment of an effective therapeutic
  treatment plan for COVID-19 patients.
