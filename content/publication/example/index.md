abstract: 'The interaction between microglia and astrocytes significantly
  influences neuroinflammation. Microglia/astrocytes, part of the neurovascular
  unit (NVU), are activated by various brain insults. The local extracellular
  and intracellular signals determine their characteristics and switch of
  phenotypes. Microglia and astrocytes are activated into two polarization
  states: the pro-inflammatory phenotype (M1 and A1) and the anti-inflammatory
  phenotype (M2 and A2). During neuroinflammation, induced by stroke or
  lipopolysaccharides, microglia are more sensitive to pathogens, or damage;
  they are thus initially activated into the M1 phenotype and produce common
  inflammatory signals such as IL-1 and TNF-Î± to trigger reactive astrocytes
  into the A1 phenotype. These inflammatory signals can be amplified not only by
  the self-feedback loop of microglial activation but also by the unique anatomy
  structure of astrocytes. As the pathology further progresses, resulting in
  local environmental changes, M1-like microglia switch to the M2 phenotype, and
  M2 crosstalk with A2. While astrocytes communicate simultaneously with neurons
  and blood vessels to maintain the function of neurons and the blood-brain
  barrier (BBB), their subtle changes may be identified and responded by
  astrocytes, and possibly transferred to microglia. Although both microglia and
  astrocytes have different functional characteristics, they can achieve immune
  "optimization" through their mutual communication and cooperation in the NVU
  and build a cascaded immune network of amplification.'
