abstract: Ferroptosis is a term that describes one form of regulated
  non-apoptotic cell death. It is triggered by the iron-dependent accumulation
  of lipid peroxides. Emerging evidence suggests a link between ferroptosis and
  the pathophysiological processes of neurological disorders, including stroke,
  degenerative diseases, neurotrauma, and cancer. Hemorrhagic stroke, also known
  as intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), belongs to a devastating illness for its
  high level in morbidity and mortality. Currently, there are few established
  treatments and limited knowledge about the mechanisms of post-ICH neuronal
  death. The secondary brain damage after ICH is mainly attributed to oxidative
  stress and hemoglobin lysate, including iron, which leads to irreversible
  damage to neurons. Therefore, ferroptosis is becoming a common trend in
  research of neuronal death after ICH. Accumulative data suggest that the
  inhibition of ferroptosis may effectively prevent neuronal ferroptosis,
  thereby reducing secondary brain damage after ICH in animal models.
  Ferroptosis has a close relationship with oxidative damage and iron
  metabolism. This review reveals the pathological pathways and regulation
  mechanism of ferroptosis following ICH and then offers potential intervention
  strategies to mitigate neuron death and dysfunction after ICH.
