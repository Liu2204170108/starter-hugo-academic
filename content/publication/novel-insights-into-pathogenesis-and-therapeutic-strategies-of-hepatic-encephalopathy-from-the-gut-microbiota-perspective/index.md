abstract: Since the 1950s, gradual changes in the gut microbiota of patients
  with hepatic encephalopathy have been observed. Previous research has
  indicated potential associations between the gut and brain, and the gut
  microbiota is becoming a hot topic in research on diseases of the nervous
  system. However, for the past few decades, studies of hepatic encephalopathy
  have been restricted to controlling the gut microbiota during macroscopic
  manipulation, such as probiotic intervention, while its clinical use remains
  controversial, and the cellular mechanisms underlying this condition are still
  poorly understood. This thesis seeks to comprehensively understand and explain
  the role of gut microbiota in hepatic encephalopathy as well as analyze the
  effects of intervention by regulating the gut microbiota. Evidence is
  presented that shows that dysbiosis of the gut microbiota is the primary
  pathological driver of hepatic encephalopathy and impacts pathologic
  progression via complex regulatory networks. As a result, suggestions were
  identified for future mechanistic research and improvements in therapeutic
  strategies for hepatic encephalopathy.
