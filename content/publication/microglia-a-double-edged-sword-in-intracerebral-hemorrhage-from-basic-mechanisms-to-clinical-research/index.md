abstract: Microglia are the resident immune cells of the central nervous system
  (CNS). It is well established that microglia are activated and polarized to
  acquire different inflammatory phenotypes, either pro-inflammatory or
  anti-inflammatory phenotypes, which act as a critical component in the
  neuroinflammation following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Microglia produce
  pro-inflammatory mediators at the early stages after ICH onset,
  anti-inflammatory microglia with neuroprotective effects appear to be
  suppressed. Previous research found that driving microglia towards an
  anti-inflammatory phenotype could restrict inflammation and engulf cellular
  debris. The principal objective of this review is to analyze the phenotypes
  and dynamic profiles of microglia as well as their shift in functional
  response following ICH. The results may further the understanding of the
  body's self-regulatory functions involving microglia following ICH. On this
  basis, suggestions for future clinical development and research are provided.
