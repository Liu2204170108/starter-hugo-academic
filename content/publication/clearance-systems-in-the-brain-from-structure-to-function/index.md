abstract: As the most metabolically active organ in the body, there is a
  recognized need for pathways that remove waste proteins and neurotoxins from
  the brain. Previous research has indicated potential associations between the
  clearance system in the brain and the pathological conditions of the central
  nervous system (CNS), due to its importance, which has attracted considerable
  attention recently. In the last decade, studies of the clearance system have
  been restricted to the glymphatic system. However, removal of toxic and
  catabolic waste by-products cannot be completed independently by the
  glymphatic system, while no known research or article has focused on a
  comprehensive overview of the structure and function of the clearance system.
  This thesis addresses a neglected aspect of linkage between the structural
  composition and main components as well as the role of neural cells throughout
  the clearance system, which found evidence that the components of CNS
  including the glymphatic system and the meningeal lymphatic system interact
  with a neural cell, such as astrocytes and microglia, to carry out vital
  clearance functions. As a result of this evidence that can contribute to a
  better understanding of the clearance system, suggestions were identified for
  further clinical intervention development of severe conditions caused by the
  accumulation of metabolic waste products and neurotoxins in the brain, such as
  Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD).
