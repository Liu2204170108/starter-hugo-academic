abstract: Sarcopenia is a systemic disease with progressive and generalized
  skeletal muscle dysfunction defined by age-related low muscle mass, high
  content of muscle slow fibers, and low muscle function. Muscle phenotypes and
  sarcopenia risk are heritable; however, the genetic architecture and molecular
  mechanisms underlying sarcopenia remain largely unclear. In recent years,
  significant progress has been made in determining susceptibility loci using
  genome-wide association studies. In addition, recent advances in omics
  techniques, including genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and
  metabolomics, offer new opportunities to identify novel targets to help us
  understand the pathophysiology of sarcopenia. However, each individual
  technology cannot capture the entire view of the biological complexity of this
  disorder, while integrative multi-omics analyses may be able to reveal new
  insights. Here, we review the latest findings of multi-omics studies for
  sarcopenia and provide an in-depth summary of our current understanding of
  sarcopenia pathogenesis. Leveraging multi-omics data could give us a holistic
  understanding of sarcopenia etiology that may lead to new clinical
  applications. This review offers guidance and recommendations for fundamental
  research, innovative perspectives, and preventative and therapeutic
  interventions for sarcopenia.
