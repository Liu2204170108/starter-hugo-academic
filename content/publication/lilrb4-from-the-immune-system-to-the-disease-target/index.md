abstract: Leukocyte immunoglobulin (Ig)-like receptor B4 (LILRB4) is a member of
  leukocyte Ig-like receptors (LILRs), which associate with membrane adaptors to
  signal through multiple cytoplasmic immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory
  motifs (ITIMs). Under physiological conditions, LILRB4 plays a very important
  role in the function of the immune system through its expression on various
  immune cells, such as T cells and plasma cells. Under pathological conditions,
  LILRB4 affects the processes of various diseases, such as the transformation
  and infiltration of tumors and leukemias, through various signaling pathways.
  Differential expression of LILRB4 is present in a variety of immune system
  diseases, such as Kawasaki disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and
  sepsis. Recent studies have shown that LILRB4 also plays a role in mental
  illness. The important role of LILRB4 in the immune system and its
  differential expression in a variety of diseases make LILRB4 a potential
  prophylactic and therapeutic target for a variety of diseases.
