abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common persistent arrhythmia, but
  the mechanism of AF has not been fully elucidated, and existing approaches to
  diagnosis and treatment face limitations. Recently, exosomes have attracted
  considerable interest in AF research due to their high stability, specificity
  and cell-targeting ability. The aim of this review is to summarize recent
  literature, analyze the advantages and limitations of exosomes, and to provide
  new ideas for their use in understanding the mechanism and improving the
  diagnosis and treatment of AF.
