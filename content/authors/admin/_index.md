Jiachen-Liu is a diligent researcher with extensive multi-/inter-disciplinary expertise in **biostatistics and bioinformatics methodology research, big data, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, complex traits and diseases** (especially osteoarthritis, sarcopenia, and obesity), metabolomics and metagenomics. 

Liu’s work is published in **15** peer-reviewed publications including journals such as ***Ageing Research Reviews, Pharmaceutics, Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorders,* and *Frontiers in immunology***. As of August 2022, these publications have been cited more than **212** times and his **H-index is 7** since the first article published in 2020. 

Liu’s primary research interests include all those areas that are related addressing the question: What and how **genetic and environmental factors** incur higher risk of, or better protection against, complex diseases, such as sarcopenia and osteoarthritis.  

Liu is also interested in **generating, analyzing and integrating big data** of various omics in vivo in humans. The purpose is to elucidate the impact of **gene expression/regulation and protein expression/modification** on the disease course in the form of **functional networks/modules/pathways** and how the knowledge gained on these molecular mechanisms in humans would translate into better **prediction/intervention/precision medicine and drug development.**
