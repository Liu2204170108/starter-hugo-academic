Jiachen-Liu is a diligent researcher with extensive multi-/inter-disciplinary expertise in **biostatistics and bioinformatics, big data, genetics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, complex traits and diseases** (especially osteoarthritis, sarcopenia, and obesity), metabolomics and metagenomics. 

Liu’s work is published in **22** peer-reviewed publications including journals such as ***Redox Biology, Molecular Cancer, Ageing Research Reviews, Journal of Translational Medicine, Human Genetics and Therapeutic Advances in Neurological Disorder***. As of Jan 2025, these publications have been cited more than **1000** times and his **H-index is 15** since the first article published in 2020. Liu currently serves on the editorship/ed-itorial boards of journals(e.g.,***iMeta***) and has reviewed over 130 manuscripts across more than 40 SCI journals, including ***Obesity Reviews, International Journal of Surgery, Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism,*** and ***Molecular Neurobiology.***

Liu’s primary research interests include all those areas that are related to addressing the question: What and how **gene expression network and environmental factors** incur higher risk of, or better protection against, complex diseases, such as sarcopenia and osteoarthritis.  

Liu is also interested in **generating, analyzing and integrating big data** of various omics in vivo in humans. The purpose is to elucidate the impact of **gene expression/regulation and protein expression/modification** on the disease course in the form of **functional networks/modules/pathways** and how the knowledge gained on these molecular mechanisms in humans would translate into better **prediction/intervention/precision medicine and drug development.**
