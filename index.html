Jiachen-Liu is a diligent researcher with extensive multi-/inter-disciplinary expertise in biostatistics and bioinformatics methodology research, big data, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, complex traits and diseases (especially osteoarthritis, sarcopenia, and obesity), metabolomics and metagenomics. Liu’s work is published in 17 peer-reviewed publications including journals such as Ageing Research Reviews, Pharmaceutics, Ther Adv Neurol Disord, and Frontiers in immunology. As of August 2022, these publications have been cited more than 163 times and his H-index is 6 since the first article published in 2020. Liu’s primary research interests include all those areas that are related addressing the question: What and how genetic and environmental factors incur higher risk of, or better protection against, complex diseases, such as sarcopenia and osteoarthritis.  He is also interested in generating, analyzing and integrating big data of various omics in vivo in humans. The purpose is to elucidate the impact of gene expression/regulation and protein expression/modification on the disease course in the form of functional networks/modules/pathways and how the knowledge gained on these molecular mechanisms in humans would translate into better prediction/intervention/precision medicine and drug development.
